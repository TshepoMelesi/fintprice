                                        Pricing is important, but knowing how to factor in components
                                        when calculating for pricing is more important. Everything that 
                                        a business pays for to produce or sell a product should count as 
                                        a pricing component.

                                                important to factor them in. Because the businesses depend on
                                                them to either produce or sell products.

                                                account for them. If not, then the business will pay for these from
                                                its own profits.

                                                each chair would account for R100 of wood, R12 of wood glue and R20 of screws.

                                                it is not this easy to determine this amount. In some instances, you can look at

                                                Beside direct expenses, there are indirect expenses. Accounting for indirect expenses
                                                is not straight forward. Sometimes, some of these indirect expenses are what the

                                                that expense with a specific product. Marketing your products on social media is an

                                                In some odd cases, a business would sell a portion of their product
                                                for free, limited by use or timeframe.

                                                Some businesses combine some of these models and make up

                                                This is mostly common in businesses with a range of products and 
                                                services. This is because many services dont follow standards in 
                                                terms of pricing and profiting from them. At the center of this is 
                                                business sustainability.
